# @electric-sql/pglite Best Practices

- Use `pglite` for client-side PostgreSQL database operations.
- Ensure proper initialization and connection management of the `pglite` instance.
- Handle asynchronous operations with `async/await` for database queries.
- Implement robust error handling for database interactions.
- Consider data synchronization strategies if `pglite` is used in conjunction with a remote database.
